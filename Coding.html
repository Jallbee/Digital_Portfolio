		<p style="text-align: center"> The first thing I want to start off with is a little bit about this website itself. 
			<br>Using my Web Programing minor I decided the best way to show my skills was to code it on my own. 
			<br>I have included the Git Hub link to view all of my code for this website as well as the other website I have been working on this semester. 
			<br> Coding has a special place in my heart, it's something that I unexpectedly fell in love with during my time here at URI. </p>
			<br>Here are some screen shots of my code followed by the Github link to view all of my code for this Digital Portfolio as well as another project from the semester.
